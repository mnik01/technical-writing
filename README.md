The pre-class components introduce topics; the in-class components help students integrate and practice those topics. That said, the pre-class work, by itself, provides significant educational value.

Google provides all the materials needed to run the in-class sessions at your own organization. If you'd like to facilitate the in-class sessions for your organization, please see Facilitating Technical Writing Courses.
