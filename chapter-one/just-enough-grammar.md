# Just enough grammar (optional)
> Время прочтения: 10 минут

This unit provides just enough grammar to understand the remainder of the course. If you already know some grammar, move on to Words. Otherwise, read on.

For simplicity's sake, this unit takes a few shortcuts; grammatical topics are actually wildly more complicated than this unit suggests.

Grammarians don't all agree on the number or types of parts of speech. The following table focuses on the parts of speech relevant to this course:

| Part of Speech | Definition                                           | Example                                        |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Noun           | a person, place, concept, or thing                   | Sam runs races.                                |
| Pronoun        | a noun that replaces another noun (or larger structure) | Sam runs races. He likes to compete.           |
| Adjective      | a word or phrase that modifies a noun                | Sam wears blue shoes.                          |
| Verb           | an action word or phrase                             | Sam runs races.                                |
| Adverb         | a word or phrase that modifies a verb, an adjective, or another adverb | Sam runs slowly.                             |
| Preposition    | a word or phrase specifying the positional relationship of two nouns | Sam's sneakers are seldom on his shelf.     |
| Conjunction    | a word that connects two nouns or phrases            | Sam's trophies and ribbons live only in his imagination. |
| Transition     | a word or phrase that connects two sentences         | Sam runs races weekly. However, he finishes races weakly. |


## Nouns

Nouns represent people, places, or things. Judy, Antarctica, and hammers are all nouns, but so are intangible concepts like robustness and perfection. In the following example passage, we've formatted the nouns in bold:

> In the framework, an object must copy any underlying values that the object wants to change. The protos in the codebase are huge, so copying the protos is unacceptably expensive.

In programming, you might think of classes and variables as your program's nouns.

### Exercise
Identify the six nouns in the following passage:

> C enables programmers to control pointers and memory. Great power brings great responsibility.

<details>

<summary>See the answer</summary>

You can find the nouns in boldface:
> C enables programmers to control pointers and memory. Great power brings great responsibility.
Now suppose the second sentence was the following:
> Great control brings great responsibility.
Is "control" a verb or is it a noun?

In this context, "control" is a noun, even though "to control" in the first sentence is a verb. Many words in English serve as a noun in some contexts and a verb in others.
